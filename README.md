This project is developed by Ghada Bahloul & Juda Hamila for our End of Bachelor Studies Project - 2013.

This is an Android mobile application for surveying.
It is intended for small entities who want a simple way to make surveys in any domain.
The administrator of the application can create new surveys and view statistics about them.
The users of the application should be able to create accounts, view the list of surveys and respond to them, view their history and statistics if available.

Open the project with Eclipse.
